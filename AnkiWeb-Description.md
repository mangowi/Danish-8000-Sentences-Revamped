This is a deck of 8,000 Sentences in Danish with translations and audio, ordered from easiest to hardest. Make sure to set "Show new cards in order added" in your deck options. It is great for a beginner in Danish, as the cards start easy and get harder as you go.

This deck is based on the deck "‚Üí Danish 8 000 sentences sorted from easiest to hardest" <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162908183" rel="nofollow">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162908183</a>
This is a modification, with the author's permission. Check out his deck page to see how he created the deck.

Changes:
 - 2 way cards. There are cards asking Danish -&gt; English, as well as English -&gt; Danish. This way the knowledge is not just one way.
 - Audio updated to Danish TTS via AwesomeTTS and GoogleAPI. The pronunciation is much better now.
    - This also reduces the deck size from 144MB to ~65MB


This deck is managed <a href="https://github.com/ll-in-anki/Danish-8000-Sentences-Revamped" rel="nofollow">on Github</a> using my ongoing Source&lt;--&gt;Anki management program <a href="https://github.com/ohare93/brain-brew" rel="nofollow">Brain Brew</a>. This allows the deck to be in an easily editable format in source control, so many maintainers can edit it, with the ability to transform the cards to or from Anki! If you are not technically minded but have made some changes/improvements to the deck that you would like to share with the other users, well your changes to this deck can be included simply by uploading an export of your current deck to a maintainer! Open <a href="https://github.com/ll-in-anki/Danish-8000-Sentences-Revamped/issues/new" rel="nofollow">an issue on the Github repo</a> with a description of your changes, and we'll talk üëç

‚ùó The Anki add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631" rel="nofollow">Morphman</a> is highly recommended for a deck of this size! ‚ùó While the deck may be ordered from easiest to hardest, there is still a lot of wasted time in reviewing things you already know. Seeing 5 different cards along the lines of "He touched her shoulder", "She touched his shoulder", "They...", etc, can get boring. Morphman will order the deck for you, so that you always only see at least 1 new word! It is a massive timesaver, though it takes a bit of effort to get setup. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220134610if_/https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/morphman/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for the best explanation I have seen, and there are plenty of YouTube videos that go over Morphman setup. 

Best of luck! Dansk er sv√¶rt!
