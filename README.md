Anki deck of 8,000 Sentences in Danish with translations and audio, ordered from easiest to hardest. It is great for a beginner in Danish, as the cards start easy and get harder as you go.

❗ The Anki add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631" rel="nofollow">Morphman</a> is highly recommended for a deck of this size! ❗ While the deck may be ordered from easiest to hardest, there is still a lot of wasted time in reviewing things you already know. Seeing 5 different cards along the lines of "He touched her shoulder", "She touched his shoulder", "They...", etc, can get boring. Morphman will order the deck for you, so that you always only see at least 1 new word! It is a massive timesaver, though it takes a bit of effort to get setup. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220134610if_/https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/morphman/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for the best explanation I have seen, and there are plenty of YouTube videos that go over Morphman setup.
